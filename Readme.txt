## Simple Financial Chatbot - Prototype

This chatbot answers predefined financial queries based on data from Apple Inc. for FY 2023.

### Supported Queries:
- What is the total revenue?
- What is the net income change over the last year?
- What is the current total assets?
- How much are the total liabilities?
- Whatâ€™s the cash flow from operating activities?

### How It Works:
- It uses simple `if-else` logic to match user queries.
- Data is pulled from a Python dictionary simulating a knowledge base.

### Limitations:
- Can only respond to exact, predefined questions.
- No understanding of natural language or typos.
